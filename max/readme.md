# Finding The Maximum Value

Hello, future programmers! Today, we have an exciting challenge for you: finding the maximum value from a set of numbers. Let's break down the problem into smaller steps to make it easier to understand.

## Access Assignment:
Copy and paste this line into your terminal window - `git clone https://github.com/heyajay312/Problems.git`

## Input Numbers:
You'll be given a variable called numSize that represents the number of values you need to find the maximum from. No need to worry about how many numbers the user will input; numSize has got you covered!
You'll be given a variable called `numSize` that represents the number of values you need to find the maximum from. No need to worry about how many numbers the user will input; `numSize` has got you covered!

## Collecting Data:
Your only task is to write in a function called find_max that takes an array of numbers and returns the maximum value among them.
Your only task is to write a function called `find_max` that takes an array of numbers and returns the maximum value among them.

## Printing the Result:
After you've found the maximum value using your function, the program will print it out for you to see.

## How to Check your Code:
Copy and paste this line into your terminal window - `check50 heyajay312/check/main/max`. Then, after some time, you can check your result.

## Conclusion:
Your challenge is to complete the find_max function to correctly identify the maximum value in the array of numbers. Don't worry if it seems a bit challenging at first â€“ take your time, experiment, and have fun with it!
